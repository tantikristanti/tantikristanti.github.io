title: "grobid-medical-report"
excerpt: "grobid-medical-report is a [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) module for extracting and restructuring medical reports from raw documents (PDF, text) into encoded documents (XML/TEI). All models built in this module are machine learning models that implement Wapiti CRF as Grobid's default models (it's possible to use deep learning models developed with [DeLFT](https://github.com/kermitt2/delft/) in Grobid as an alternative to the Wapiti CRF).<br/><img src='/images/grobid-medical-report.png'>"
