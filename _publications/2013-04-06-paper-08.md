excerpt: 'Security of data and information becomes one of the most important components in a computer-based system. A system can be said in a secure condition if it satisfies four elements - assurance that the information is only accessed by authorized parties (confidentiality), guarantee of accuracy (integrity), originality of the information (authenticity), and guarantee that the information is accessible when needed (availability). To satisfy the four elements in managing a computer-based information systems, particularly in a Web-based application, management of data and information security needs to be done. This article discusses how to secure data and information through a web-based application using the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm. RSA implementation and testing had been tested on a web-based application at the University &quot;X&quot; with the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) as the secure link between the clients and server. RSA is asymmetric cryptographic algorithms that use a pair of keys, i.e. public key and private key. The key length can be adjusted, thus the longer the key size is, the more difficult it can be cracked.'
